Banaras Hindu University(pronunciationâ“˜) (BHU), formerly Benares Hindu University,[6] is a collegiate, central, and research university located in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India, and founded in 1916. The university incorporated the Central Hindu College, which had been founded by theosophist and future Indian Home Rule leader Annie Besant in 1898.[7][8] By 1911 Besant was marginalised on the governing board of the College by Madan Mohan Malviya who preferred a more traditional Hinduism with its hereditary caste system[9] to Besant's more theosophical one.[10] Five years later Malaviya established the university with the support of the maharaja of Darbhanga Rameshwar Singh, the maharaja of Benares Prabhu Narayan Singh, and the lawyer Sunder Lal.

With over 30,000 students, and 18,000 residing on campus, BHU is the largest residential university in Asia.[11][12] The university is one of the eight public institutions declared as an Institute of Eminence by the Government of India.[13][14] It is also one of the 12 institutions from India in BRICS Universities League, a consortium of leading research universities from BRICS countries.[15] The university's main campus spread over 1,370 acres (5.5 km2), was built on land donated by Prabhu Narayan Singh, the hereditary ruler of Benares State. The south campus, spread over 2,700 acres (11 km2) is built on land donated later by Aditya Narayan Singh in Sunderpur,[16] hosts the Krishi Vigyan Kendra (Agriculture Science Centre)[17] and is located in Barkachha in Mirzapur district, about 60 km (37 mi) from Varanasi.
