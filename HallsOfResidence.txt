BHU is a fully residential university with a total of 66 hostels[60] - 41 hostels for male, 21 hostels for female students, and 4 hostels for International students.[61][62]

Hostels in the university are divided among different faculties, institutes, campuses, and colleges catering to their specific demands.[63] Out of the four separate hostels for international students, two are for boys and the other two for girls.[61][63]

Hostels of the university are named after several historically important figures such as Raja Baldev Das Jugal Kishore Birla, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Rani Laxmibai and M. Visvesvaraya.[61] Some hostels are named after important rivers of India; 'Triveni' for instance was initially a cluster of three girls' hostels named after rivers Ganga, Yamuna, and Sarasvati; thereby the cluster being called after Triveni Sangam. Later, hostels named after river Godavari and Kaveri were also added to the 'Triveni' block.[64]

BHU also provides on-campus residence to a substantial number of teaching and non-teaching staff. There are 654 quarters for teaching staff, 688 quarters for non-teaching staff.[65]
